<!-- // Guess what letter I'm thinking of

// Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

// Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

// Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

// Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

// pseudo code: 
// first, computer must pick a random letter a-z/1-26
// user must guess computer's chosen letter
// guess is displayed on html page
// set number of allowed guesses 
// game increases number of guesses until user wins/loses
// if user guesses correctly, wins increases by 1 
// if user guesses incorrectly, loses increases by 1
